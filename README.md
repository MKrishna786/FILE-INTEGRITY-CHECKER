File Integrity Checker is a tool or system that verifies whether files on a computer or server have been altered, deleted, or tampered with. It works by comparing the current state of a file against a known good baseline, usually using cryptographic hashes like MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256.

Main Functions of a File Integrity Checker:
Baseline Creation: Generates checksums/hashes for files when the system is in a trusted state.

Monitoring/Scanning: Periodically or manually checks files for changes by comparing current hashes with baseline hashes.

Alerting: Notifies the user or administrator if discrepancies are found.
Why It's Important:
Detects unauthorized modifications (e.g., malware injections).
Helps ensure system security and data integrity.

Supports regulatory compliance (like PCI-DSS, HIPAA).
